        <p>
          There was once a girl who thought her life was boring, never filled
          with excitement and it was the same day in and day out. She wanted
          something different, something more, something that would give her
          life meaning, but alas she didn’t know what this something was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Elenor Hades. A proud member of the Hades household or
          so I delude myself to be, and what others tell me, and my status in
          this house? I am the Queen’s daughter of course. You thought I was a
          mere country bumkin, didn’t you? Well, I do not blame you and I will
          forgive you for having such awful, vile thoughts towards the future
          Queen of Alfuria. Yes, you heard me right, the kingdom I am bound to
          rule as the great Queen mother is called Alfuria. I am sorry for being
          rude. I am not like that I promise, pinky promise. I was just playing
          with you. So don’t hate me, please. So, you forgive me, right? Great!!
          Now we are the best of friends!
        </p>
        <p>
          And as my friend, I must tell you why you are here today. You are here
          to know the tale of the great Elenor Hades, or so it’s supposed to be.
          …
        </p>
        <p>
          From an early age Elenor was always told that she would be a great
          person one day. A person that will rule a whole nation. Her fate was
          sealed since birth, a burden she will have to carry until death. There
          was no changing fate, and that fate felt like a cage. A cage she will
          never be able to escape from. At first, she felt excited, being able
          to make decisions for other people, owning her own castle, having to
          eat whenever she wanted and always being treated with respect and
          kindness. She thought when she grew up, she was going to become as
          great as her mother, Queen Alvira Hades. And rule the nation and make
          it prosperous. Well, that’s what she was told anyway.
        </p>
        <p>01 September, Year 1656.</p>
        <p>
          The room was thick with tension, air pulsing between pain and
          determination. Her breaths came heavy, sharp, controlled only by pure
          determination. The Queen, trembling, filled with exhaustion, gave one
          final push. And then, the world paused. A single sound broke through,
          raw and loud. The baby’s cry. The nurses moved, wrapping the baby in a
          soft blue cloth. They placed the baby on her chest. She stared at the
          new life, with no emotion. No fear, no joy, no love, only a half-faked
          smile. She hovered her index finger over her mouth and the baby went
          silent. One of the nurses took the baby out of the room, and the baby
          started crying again.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Her name is Elenor,” the queen said and waved her hand to the
          remaining nurses signaling them to leave her alone. The nurses bowed
          and left the room. A maid came in after the nurses left. Her name was
          Nelli. She was the head maid in the palace and the Queen’s personal
          maid. Nelli was incredibly beautiful, she had jet black hair that was
          tied into a bun on the back, brown eyes, small nose, and soft blush
          pink lips with light brown skin. She was wearing a black knee-length
          dress with a white apron, it had short sleeves, and a small collar. A
          fitted waist, giving a neat appearance with stocking, and black
          low-heeled shoes, and white gloves too. She was holding a tray with a
          pot of tea and a cup. She put the tray on a table and poured some tea
          for her majesty. The Queen was sitting up straight on her bed. Nelli
          went up to her and gave her the tea. Alvira nodded with approval and
          stood up from the bed and went to sit on a chair near the table as she
          drank her tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly four maids and a healer came into Alvira’s room. The maids’
          dresses were longer than Nelli’s. The maids quickly cleaned up the
          mess and changed the bed itself. The healer went to Alvira and healed
          the pain she felt after giving birth. After the healer was done, she
          went to take a long warm bath, like everything was a norm to her. She
          stepped out of the bathroom wearing a light transparent purple short
          dress. Her blonde hair damped and clung to her shoulders in golden
          strands. Tiny droplets traced down her porcelain-fair skin. Her eyes
          were crystal blue, no emotion eluding them. She moved with slow,
          unhurried grace. The scent of lavender faintly in the air behind her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nelli stood in the room waiting for her majesty to finish bathing.
          “Nelli, there’s something weird about that child,” Alvira said. “Care
          to explain further your majesty?” Nelli asked. “Well, when I had
          hovered my index finger over my mouth, she immediately stopped crying,
          like she knew what I was trying to say,” Alvira answered. “Your
          majesty, this has happened before.” Nelli commented. “Oh?” Alvira
          questioned. Nelli continued, “Yes, when the late Queen had given birth
          to you. You acted the same way, but difference is, you never cried
          even after you were taken from the late Queen.” “Hm is that so? I
          see,” Alvira said not giving it much thought. “I want to rest now, you
          can return to your living courters now Nelli,” she added. “Of course,
          your majesty,” Nelli bowed and left the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five years had passed, and Elenor had grown to be a beautiful child.
          She looked more like her mother, knee-length blonde hair, crystal blue
          eyes with perfect light skin. Alvira never visited her daughter.
          Elenor only saw her mother during dinner, and they never even talked.
          The conversations only ended with greetings. Elenor felt sad that her
          own mother kept her distance from her like she was the plague. She did
          not know what she did wrong, and she never dared to ask her mother
          about it. After all she had everything, she could ask for. She was
          allowed to play outside in the palace garden with some maids, or they
          would hire children to play with her. She felt happy, but one thing
          was nosing at the back of her mind.
        </p>
        <p>12 February Year 1661</p>
        <p>
          Elenor was playing in the palace garden again with one of the maids’
          daughters. Her name was Lana. Lana had short brown hair, brown eyes
          and light, a little pale skin, she was wearing a maids’ uniform. She
          was Elenor’s best friend. Elenor fell as they were playing tag.
          “Princess Elenor, are you okay? I hope you aren’t hurt in any way,”
          Lana said with a worried tone as she went to her. One of the guards
          that were standing by hurriedly went to where the two girls were to
          check if it was something serious. “Don’t worry, I didn’t get hurt,”
          Elenor said with a smile on her face. The guard insisted they go
          inside to get some rest even though nothing happened. With sad faces
          they reluctantly went to Elenor’s room. They sat on her bed and
          contemplated on what to do. “I have an idea,” Lana said with a
          mischievous look on her face. “I’m listening,” Elenor said giggling.
          “Remember when you said you wanted to explore the castle? I think now
          it’s the perfect time,” Lana said with excitement in her voice. “Oh
          yeah, I remember now, the palace is TOO big to explore alone, let’s do
          it! But we must be really quiet about this,” Elenor replied with even
          more excitement. “I am a ninja,” Lana said covering her face with her
          hands. “Lana, I swear you say the oddest things,” Elenor said while
          laughing. And they set off on their new adventure. If only they knew
          what was waiting for them at the end of their ‘adventure’.
        </p>
        <p>
          They started from the kitchen, where they had some snacks. They
          decided to go to where the maids live, then where they did the
          laundry, and where they had they’re lunch breaks and same with the
          guards too. At some point they had wondered off to a place they had
          never been or heard of before. It was a big dark hallway, with barely
          any lights on the walls and the floors were dirty like it was not
          maintained for years. “Elenor, do you know where we are?” Lana asked a
          bit concerned. “Mee? I don’t know,” she said with a trembling voice.
          Then up ahead of them, they saw a big, massive door opening. They
          quickly hid behind one of the pillars in the hallway and peeked to see
          what would come in from it. They saw Nelli the head maid coming in
          from the door. The girls looked at each other in confusion then
          curiosity. They let Nelli pass. And they looked at the door. Elenor’s
          feet moved on their own towards the door. Slowly but surely. When Lana
          saw that Elenor was moving, she put her hand on her shoulder. “Hey,
          what are you doing? We shouldn’t go there.” Lana said with concern
          filling her face and fear griping her heart. Elenor snapped out of her
          daze when she felt Lana’s hand on her shoulder. “Huh, what?” she said
          confused. “What do you mean by that? You didn’t hear what I said? You
          were going to the door,” Lana said concerned. “I don’t know why but I
          feel like I should go there,” Elenor said with determination. With
          that said, they both went to the door, hand in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          They stood right in front of the door. “So how do we open the door?”
          Lana asked. It was a big plain metal door with no handle to push or
          pull it open. “Maybe it’s one of those doors where you open with magic
          words,” Elenor answered. “Oh mighty door open for the royal family of
          the Alfuria kingdom,” Lana said half-jokingly. “You really thought
          that would work?” Elenor laughed. “You have any better ideas?” Lana
          pouted. They said so many words in the hopes of opening it. Two hours
          went by and still nothing. Lana then had an idea; she touched the door
          with the palm of her hand and an immediate electric shock when through
          her whole hand and she screamed in pain. “Lana! Are you okay?” Elenor
          said with concern as she went to Lana to check on her. “It really
          hurts but the pain feels like its fading away, little by little so
          don’t worry,” Lana replied in pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Are you sure?” she asked again. “Yes, I am. Just give me a few
          minutes,” Lana assured her. She nodded and looked at the door. “Maybe
          I should touch it,” she said. Lana opened her eyes in shock. “What if
          the same thing happens to you?”. “We’ll see what happens,” Elenor said
          as she walked to the door. She hesitantly put the palm of her hand on
          the door and her eyes glowed blue, for a second and the door opened.
          “The door is opening,” Lana said in excitement. A white light could be
          seen blocking what was beyond the door. “A teleportation door? Let’s
          go in,” Elenor said in anticipation and fear. They held each other
          hand by hand and went inside the teleporter.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they opened their eyes, they saw that they were in a large
          hallway, much similar to the one they had come from but this one much
          tidier and brighter. “Oh, Miss Nelli, I see you…” a man that looked
          like a butler paused when he saw the two girls. “What are little girls
          doing here?” he asked with a worried expression. Elenor stepped
          forward and introduced herself. “I am princess Elenor, Elenor Hades,
          and this is my best friend, Lana.” “Ah, I see whats going on. Well
          Princess Elenor Hades and Miss Lana, my name is Paul, a butler in this
          part of the palace. Now if you don’t mind, please follow me” Paul
          bowed and gave them a warm smile and turned around and walked off.
          “You said part of the Palace; what did you mean by that?” Elenor
          asked, a bit fearful of where he’s taking them. “Princess Elenor, you
          do not need to worry. Everything will be explained to you shortly.” He
          replied, as he led them to a big dining room.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Your majesties we have unexpected guests, may they come in?” A
          handsome man that looked to be in his forties, with jet black hair,
          silver eyes and light skin. He was wearing a blue gown with traces of
          gold on it. He was sitting on one of the biggest chairs at the end of
          the table, he answered Paul. “You can let them in Paul, it’s no
          problem.” He nodded and let the two girls in. “Oh, very unexpected
          indeed.” The man said in surprise. Elenor froze after seeing the man
          at the head of the table, a tear dropped down her face. “Elenor, you…”
          Lana was interrupted by the man as he stood up his chair and went to
          Elenor. “Hm, Elenor you say, I should’ve guessed as much at first
          glance.” The man said as he kneeled down and whipped the tears off of
          her face. He picked her up and held Lana’s hand and went to the dining
          table.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made Lana sit on one of the chairs and he went back to his chair
          and put Elenor on his lap. “Why are you crying Elenor?” the man asked
          with a sweet, gentle and loving tone. Elenor a bit surprised and
          confused, “I’m crying? I… I don’t know. Do I know you?” The man looked
          at her with a sad and regretful face. “Well, we only met once when you
          were young. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to recognize you.” “What do you
          mean?” she asked even more confused. “What I am trying to say is,” he
          takes a heavy breath and continues, “…I am your dad Elenor, and look
          in front of you, this is your family.” He finished, regret and shame
          lingering in his voice. “F-f-family?” Elenor asked in a trembling
          voice as she looked around. She hadn’t noticed the people sitting on
          the chairs until now. She was dazed when she had looked at this man in
          front of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I have a family other than my mother?” she asked in fear but with a
          hint of excitement in her voice. “Yes, and these are all your
          brothers, Arthur Hades your eldest brother,” He was a handsome man
          that looked to be in his mid-twenties. He had long blonde hair,
          crystal blue eyes, with crystal clear light skin that gave off a
          little enchanting glow under the lights. “Zephyr Starfall your second
          eldest brother,” He was a handsome young man that looked to be in his
          early twenties. Had short black hair with golden strands on it, with
          silver eyes and illuminating light skin with little brown spots all
          over his body. “And Sebastian Starfall, your third elder brother.” He
          looked to be around 18 to 19 years old. Basically, he looks like
          Satoru Gojo, and he has Albinism. “And I am your father. Lucian
          Starfall. I am deeply sorry we had to meet like this, but I had
          planned to see you in a few years’ time.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Brother Arthur, brother Zephyr, brother Sebastian and you are my
          daddy?” Elenor asked with wide eyes and curiosity. “Wait, what did you
          mean by you planned to meet me in a few years? And why does everyone
          have different last names except for big brother Arthur? And and why
          haven’t I ever heard that I have a daddy and big brothers?” she
          continued with the questions. “Woah woah, slow down there little Elen,
          there is a lot that I need to tell you but right now it’s not the
          perfect time.” Lucian said with a sad look on his face. “But but I
          want to know what is going on. You can’t leave me in the dark like
          this! It’s not fair!” she got off from Lucian lap and ran out of the
          dining room with tears on her face. “Elenor!” Lana shouted as she got
          out off her seat and wanted to go after her, but Lucian stopped her.
          “Arthur, go after her.” He told Arthur
        </p>
        <p>
          He stood up and immediately went after her. He asked the staff if they
          had seen where Elenor ran off to. They pointed him in the right
          direction, and he eventually found her in Sebastian’s room, on his bed
          curled up under his bed sheets. “You know it’s not good to come into
          someone’s house uninvited and run around in it, you can get lost very
          easily.” He said with a stoic, regal voice with a little bit of
          gentleness in it as he went up to the side of the bed slowly. Elenor
          didn’t reply but she stopped crying. He continued, “Elen… little
          sister, I know you’re upset about the whole situation and Lucia… I
          mean father, did not mean to hurt you in any way. Everything he said
          to you, he said it with a heavy heart. You saw it up close since you
          were right next to him. He isn’t a bad person, and we aren’t as well.”
          Elenor took off the bed sheets and looked at Arthur with teary eyes.
          He whipped the tears away and gave her a forced warm smile. “You don’t
          do this every day, do you?” she asked, a bit amused. He shrugged it
          off like it wasn’t a big deal. “You look a lot like mother than the
          others,” she said with a bit of curiosity. He shrugged it off. “Why
          aren’t you leaving in the palace? where is this place? How come I’ve
          never heard of you before now?” she asked with a teary face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arthur sighed and said, “Elen… little sister, father, me and the
          others can’t really say anything right now but know that you are loved
          deeply, especially by our father. He wants nothing more than to tell
          you everything, for him to see you every day and spoil you like his
          little princess. But that’s just not possible. I can’t really say why
          nor tell you more but look at the bright side, you now know you have a
          whole family except for Alvi… your mother and you shouldn’t waste this
          opportunity you’ve been given to meet the rest of your family.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She was crying as she listened to Arthur speak, there was something
          about his voice that felt welcoming but cold at the same time, which
          made her emotions sway. He pulled her closer and gave her a comforting
          hug as he said, “Elenor, I know you are a smart girl, and I know you
          wouldn’t just cry all day, instead of trying to know your family with
          the limited time you have here.” Realizing what he had said was all
          true, she whipped off her tears and had a look of determination. “Yes,
          you are absolutely right big brother Arthur, thank you for making me
          understand,” she said as she put a big smile on her face. “Now let’s
          go and have launch with the rest of the family, shall we?” He stood up
          and held out his hand for her, with a forced smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they went out of Sebastian’s room, they saw that the rest of the
          family was there, and they had been eavesdropping. “Daddy!” Elenor
          shouted as he went up to Lucian for a hug. He picked her up and
          carried her on his chest with a big smile and they all went back to
          the dining room.
