        <h3>Our Little Story</h3>
        <p>
          I wasn’t expecting anything special when I logged into COD that day...
        </p>

          <p>
            I wasn’t expecting anything special when I logged into COD that day.
            Just another match, hoping to play with Moyo again, because there
            was never a dull moment with him around. Though I didn’t invite, and
            I didn’t even talk a lot. I still wasn’t fully comfortable, but I
            was still happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s when Moyo invited someone new to the lobby, his friend. I
            didn’t think much of it at first. Just another teammate. But the
            moment he joined, something shifted. He had this calm energy, kind
            of quiet but confident. I liked it. I didn’t know it yet, but the
            person who just dropped into our match would become the one I’d
            eventually fall for.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was something about his voice that made me want to hear it
            more. At first, I dismissed it, thinking it was one of those times
            where I would find a guy attractive but forget their existence since
            I never get to meet nor talk to them after that first encounter. A
            few days went by as we played together. Honestly, I never really
            expected to play with him again, so soon and so frequently.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had noticed a few things about him, but I never really tried to
            figure out what kind of a person he was. From the few words we
            exchanged, I could tell he always spoke a little awkwardly with me.
            It felt like our energies didn’t quite align. And that made me sad,
            because in some strange way, I could tell we were similar in how we
            spoke to people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t want to get close. I worried it would be awkward,
            uncomfortable, like trying to force something that wasn’t there. It
            reminded me of a time I finally talked to a girl I really wanted to
            be friends with, only to realize our conversation kept falling flat
            because we were both too awkward. That relationship never grew, and
            deep down, I was afraid the same thing would happen with him. But I
            still I blushed a little, whenever he talked to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was happy when he sent me a friend request, it felt nice, like
            maybe he wanted to know me better. But at the same time, I still
            felt like it was easier when there were other people in the lobby.
            Just the two of us felt… awkward. I wouldn’t know what to say, and I
            didn’t want to feel pressured to talk just to fill the silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point I secretly hoped that he was like Moyo. Someone
            talkative and not too awkward, alas that was only wishful thinking
            so I sticked to only playing with him when other people were there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some days when I got to the game, I would always notice that he came
            online late. And during the day he was unavailable. I didn’t think
            much about it until it happened more frequently. It made be sad,
            that sometimes I would want to sleep when he just joined in. At that
            point the tension I felt between us had lessened, so I asked why he
            came in so late.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was surprised to find out he lived a whole continent away. I had
            thought he lived in SA this whole time, but my guess was wrong. And
            Nigerian too? Wow. I couldn’t really do anything about it, so I
            didn’t dwell on it too much.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our relationship progressed really good, and it made me happy. At
            some point I felt comfortable inviting him to my lobby and the
            awkwardness didn’t bother me as it did before. I enjoyed playing
            with him and I was happy to know he did too.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time I had thought of him as one of my friends, not too close
            but I did feel a bond and that made me happy. The way he talked to
            me felt… nice. Even though sometimes it felt like he was talking to
            a child which I didn’t mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then one night when we were playing together, he asked for my
            number. It made me feel nice inside, but there was a lingering fear
            in my heart, so I declined. I felt a bit guilty for not giving him
            but stood firm on my word.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then he sent his number instead in the chat. I was honestly
            conflicted with myself. When he left the lobby, I stayed there for a
            few good minutes contemplating on if I should save it or not. I
            cursed myself and took his numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sent a text to him still knowing what I was doing wasn’t right. At
            some point I teased him, making him think I was angry at something
            he didn’t mean to do. It was honestly cute, the way he tried to
            protect himself, trying to make it up to me like I was his
            girlfriend. Cuteness overload. As we continued talking, I noticed
            that my worst fear was coming true. And it made me sad. I felt so
            stupid and horrible inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            As days went by, we didn’t play as much as we used to. I really
            missed that, the games, the presence, the little moments, but there
            wasn’t much I could do. I had warned him what giving my number would
            mean, and even then, he still wanted it. But in the end, I was the
            one who messaged first… so I blamed myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            At least I found solace in talking to him on WhatsApp. Even if we
            weren’t gaming like before, our chats felt like a little place I
            could go to, just us, no pressure. His messages were simple,
            sometimes awkward, but there was something comforting about them. I
            didn’t always know what to say, but I wanted to keep the
            conversations going.
          </p>
          <p>
            Days went by, and there was less and less to talk about. I found
            myself running out of things to say, and eventually, I just stopped
            trying to start conversations, I didn’t want it to feel forced.
            Talking to him had been nice, but I wasn’t attached, so when things
            faded, I just let it happen. There wasn’t much to feel about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I moved on with my life, but life started to be unfair. My family
            had fell apart. I had someone I thought I could confide in, but
            something felt off. They listened, sure, but from a distance. Like
            they didn’t really want to hear my problems, like they were trying
            to stay out of it. They never said it directly, but I could feel it
            in the way they brushed things off, and in how quickly they tried to
            move on from the conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t realize it then. I was overwhelmed and holding everything
            in. But now, looking back, it’s so clear, like night and day. I
            truly wished for someone else I could confide in. He came into mind,
            but I didn’t want to burden someone I barely knew with my problems.
            Things eventually settled down but there was always that lingering
            fear that things might flare up again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The person I had thought and cared about, drifted away, little by
            little. I didn’t understand why, and I wanted them to explain and
            asked them to stay. But it was all in vain. I cried for weeks
            without end. Falling into despair. I felt broken and alone. I sought
            out comfort and the person I had stopped talking to, he was the only
            person that came to mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was scared to message him at first. I felt guilty, like I was only
            reaching out to use him as an escape from all the pain I was
            carrying. All I wanted was to vent, to cry, to be heard… but it felt
            unfair to put that weight on him, so I held back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Days passed, and eventually, I gathered the courage to message him.
            And when I did, it felt like being pulled back from the edge, like
            someone had reached out and saved me from drowning. Just talking to
            him made me feel warmer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gradually, our relationship began to grow again. I felt lighter,
            even though the stress and pain of everything I’d gone through was
            still there. Somehow, he gave me this sense of calm and happiness,
            just by being there. He didn’t even realize it, but he was helping
            me heal. And for that, I am truly grateful.
          </p>
          <p>As the distance between us lessened, the happier I felt.</p>
          <p>
            The late-night calls getting know each other, the good morning
            texts, it felt like utter bliss. A dream I never wanted to wake up
            from. There were moments where we didn’t know what to talk about,
            and sometimes it felt awkward and weird, but I didn’t care about
            that anymore. I would always try to figure out a way for us to talk,
            because I wanted to cling to the feelings, he made me feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            His voice, calm like the ocean waters, filled with warmth and
            sincerity. Leaving me dazed from time to time. With a bit of weird
            and awkwardness mixed in, but I liked it. His presence was soft and
            welcoming. At some point I truly thought he was God sent, and I
            still do. Like how can such a kind and wonderful person go through
            so much pain and hardship at an early age?
          </p>
          <p>
            Time goes by and our relationship grows stronger and harder. I
            didn’t know where this would lead me, but I didn’t dwell on it as I
            felt happy talking to him and it was the only thing I cared about.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he asked me to be his Valentine, I felt overjoyed as I had
            never really had one. Even though we weren’t officially together and
            there was an immeasurable amount of distance between, I didn’t care
            and was really looking forward to that day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more our relationship advanced, the more I wanted him for
            myself. But I was scared because of the distance between us. At some
            point I had promised myself that I wouldn’t be in a long-distance
            relationship again because of the emotional trauma I had experienced
            while being in it, but there I was falling for a man I wasn’t even
            sure I would see in this life. I felt conflicted and pained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though I wanted to, I still felt like it was useless to even
            try since it would be near impossible for us to be together,
            physically. I couldn’t feel his warmth, his breath over my neck, his
            face close to mine, my hand in his, a hug and his hand on my head.
            (physical contact with Other humans is traumatizing lol)
          </p>
          <p>
            My feelings were still uncertain, but I wanted to know how he felt,
            so I asked him to be my boyfriend. The moment I sent the text, I
            felt stupid and embarrassed for asking. He didn’t really accept. It
            hurt, even just a little, but strangely, I also felt relieved. I let
            it go and tried to move on, reminding myself that, even if only for
            a short while, I was still his Valentine. For that moment, I was
            his, and that was enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life went on as normal, and I was happy. Then Valentines Day came. I
            was ecstatic and I wanted to be with him desperately, but alas, that
            was just a fleeting dream. But I sought out to find my Valentine.
            Where is he I wondered. With my great detective skills, I was able
            to find him. Playing with his friends. I felt a bit angry and
            jealous. Angry because I thought he forgot and jealous because I
            wanted him to play with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know I was being selfish, but I didn’t care as only emotions were
            driving me. It was only about what my heart wanted but at the end, I
            understood he was playing with his friends and so I asked to talk to
            him for a few minutes, but we ended up playing together and my heart
            was just dancing with joy. The moment felt surreal, I hadn’t had
            that much fun in ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then later that night he said yes. I was confused and scared at what
            he implied. When he said he wanted to make it official, I froze. I
            never expected him to say that. My feelings wavering, and fear crept
            in. But I chose to trust in him. I knew he wasn’t the kind of person
            to make a big decision like that without thinking it through
            thoroughly. I knew that. Considering the distance between us made
            everything feel almost impossible… I wanted to believe in him. In
            us.
          </p>
          <p>When he said he loved me, I couldn’t say it back.</p>
          <p>
            I wanted to. But I was scared. I felt guilty. like I was breaking an
            unspoken rule by staying silent. I had already said yes to being
            his, but my heart wasn’t ready to speak those words.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet… he never pressured me. He didn’t ask why. He just kept
            showing up, steady and kind, like he understood without needing an
            explanation. That silence, his silence, made me feel safe. And
            slowly, I began to realize…
          </p>
          <p>His love was gentle. It never demanded. It waited.</p>
          <p>
            Over time, something inside me began to shift. It wasn’t sudden. It
            wasn’t dramatic. Just small things, the way he spoke to me, how he
            always listened, how he never made me feel like I had to be anything
            more than myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            And as the days passed, I found myself thinking about him more, not
            just when I was sad or lonely, but when I’m happy too. I started
            missing him when I smile, when I laughed, when things were okay.
            That’s when I knew something had changed. Eventually I was ready. I
            told him I love him. Out loud. Not just for me to hear, but for him
            to hear it too. Not just me, not anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not just to fill the silence, but to make it real, to give the words
            the weight they deserved. Because I finally meant them, with all of
            me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still wonder why he chose to be with me, someone so far away,
            instead of someone closer, someone easier to love.
          </p>
          <p>
            I try to understand, and I do in some way… but I also don’t. I keep
            thinking,
            <i
              >what was going through your mind when you decided you wanted
              me?</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Was it something I said? The way I listened? The silence I filled
            without trying to? I don’t know.But whatever it was, you chose me.
            And even with all the distance, all the uncertainty… you stayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A seed was planted the day I first met you, small, uncertain, barely
            noticeable.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, it’s grown into something beautiful. A quiet, blooming
            flower.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ll do my best to nurture it, to care for this love, just as you
            do, with patience, with warmth, with everything I have.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t know what the future holds. The distance, the waiting, it’s
            not easy. But I hope one day, we’ll look back on all of this and
            smile, knowing we made it through.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, maybe I won’t have to miss you through a screen. One day,
            I’ll reach out and hold your hand for real. And when that day comes,
            I’ll know the flower we cared for, against all odds, was always
            meant to bloom.
