            I made this little corner of the internet just for you — for your
            birthday, and for every moment I wish I could be right next to you.
            🧡
          </p>

            Being far apart has never stopped us from feeling close, and I
            wanted to create something that lasts — something that's always here
            when you need a smile, a reminder, or a tiny heartbeat from me. This
            site is filled with pieces of us: stories, thoughts, and love you
            can tap into any time, from anywhere.
          </p>

            It’s not just code. It’s my way of reaching across the distance and
            giving you something that speaks for my heart, even when I can’t be
            there in person. I hope it makes you feel loved, because you truly
            are.
          </p>

          <p>💭 Did you know I almost gave up making this project?</p>
          <p>
            But I'm happy i didn't. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed
            creating it for you.
